# Sergeant command language concept

I came up with the idea of Sergeant as a command language on 2022 July 28th, but I didn't officially accept it as a project until 2022 August 1st. I plan for it to be a personal/small use command language, using keywords that sound similar to the way an army drill sergeant would give commands.

The example keywords I originally came up with on day 1 include:

- `do`
- `or`
- `die`
- `do or die`
- `do or`
- `go`
- `stop`
- `halt`
- `if`
- `else`
- `run
- `pause`
- `stop`
- `break`
- `order`
- - `BLPlan()`
- `I`
- `VoiceOn`
- `VoiceOff`
- `Loud`
- `Quiet`

The language by default would be in all caps, but lowercase is optional.
